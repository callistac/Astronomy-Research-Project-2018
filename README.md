# Astronomy-Research-Project-2018
Project goal was to determine what the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) will observe in the Kepler field
- What types of planets will TESS be sensitive to? (see main file: KOI_142_Analysis.py, and sub-files: KOI_142_Analysis_plot.py and TESS_transit_uncert.py)
- For planets that TESS will be most sensitive to, how much will it improve our understanding of these systems (e.g. will it reduce transit timing uncertanties, uncertainties in period, eccentricity, etc.)
- Will TESS be sensitive to tidal orbital decay in hot Jupiters?
